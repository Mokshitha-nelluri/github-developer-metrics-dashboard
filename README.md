  - *Review Time*: PR creation to first review
  - *Merge Time*: Last review to successful merge
- **Industry Benchmarks**:
  - Elite: < 24 hours
  - High: < 1 week
  - Medium: < 1 month
  - Low: > 1 month
- **Impact**: Measures team efficiency in delivering features. Lower lead times indicate better development flow, faster feedback loops, and reduced context switching costs.

#### **Deployment Frequency**
**Calculation**: Number of successful deployments (merged PRs) per week, with trend analysis
- **Tracking Methods**:
  - PR merge events as deployment proxies
  - Weekly and daily frequency calculations
  - Trend analysis over 4-week rolling periods
- **Industry Benchmarks**:

  - High: Once per day to once per week (3-10/week)
  - Medium: Once per week to once per month (1/week)
  - Low: Less than once per month
- **Impact**: Higher deployment frequency correlates with reduced risk, faster feature delivery, and improved team velocity. Enables rapid feedback and iteration.

#### **Change Failure Rate** 
**Calculation**: Percentage of deployments that result in failures requiring fixes
- **Detection Methods**:
  - Keyword analysis in PR titles/descriptions (hotfix, revert, bug, emergency)

  - Time-based correlation of fixes following deployments
- **Failure Categories**:
  - Reverts: Code rollbacks due to issues
  - Hotfixes: Emergency patches for critical problems
  - Bug fixes: General defect corrections
  - Patches: Quick fixes for minor issues
- **Industry Benchmarks**:
  - Elite: < 5%
  - High: 5-10%
  - Medium: 10-15%
  - Low: > 15%
- **Impact**: Lower failure rates indicate robust testing practices, better code quality, and mature development processes.

#### **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
**Calculation**: Average time to restore service after a failure
- **Detection Logic**:
